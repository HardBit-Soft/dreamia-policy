  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

  <p>
    By downloading or using the <strong>Dreamia</strong> app, these terms will automatically apply to you â€“ please make sure to read them carefully before using the app.
    Youâ€™re not allowed to copy, modify, or redistribute the app, any part of it, or our trademarks in any way. Youâ€™re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, translate it into other languages, or create derivative versions.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app itself, and all related trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights, remain the property of <strong>Dreamia</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dreamia is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. We reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services at any time and for any reason.
    We will never charge you for the app or its services without clearly explaining what youâ€™re paying for.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app stores and processes personal data that you provide to us in order to deliver our services. You are responsible for keeping your phone and access to the app secure.
    We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your device, as this may make your device vulnerable to malware, compromise security features, or cause the app to function improperly.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank">Apple App Store Services</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Network and Usage Responsibility</h2>
  <p>
    Certain features of the app require an active internet connection. Whether through Wi-Fi or mobile data, Dreamia cannot take responsibility if the app does not work properly due to lack of connection or depleted data allowance.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you use the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, your agreement with your mobile network provider still applies. You may be charged for data usage or other costs.
    By using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges. If you are not the bill payer for your device, we assume you have permission to use it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dreamia is not responsible if your device runs out of battery and you are unable to use the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Accuracy and Updates</h2>
  <p>
    While we make every effort to ensure that the app is up-to-date and accurate, we rely on third-party data sources. Dreamia accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, arising from your reliance on the functionality or data provided through the app.
  </p>

  <p>
    The app is currently available on Android and iOS. System requirements may change over time, and you must download updates to continue using the app. Dreamia does not guarantee compatibility with all versions of Android or iOS.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may also stop providing the app or terminate access at any time without notice. Upon termination:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All rights and licenses granted to you under these terms will end.</li>
    <li>You must stop using and delete the app from your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Abuse Prevention and Rate Limiting</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Automatic Analysis and Interruption:</strong> Dreamiaâ€™s systems continuously monitor and analyze user activity to prevent misuse or abuse.
    If any usage patterns are detected that may harm or interfere with the app or its users, access may be automatically restricted.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Daily Usage Limit:</strong> Each user can analyze <strong>only one (1) dream per day</strong>. This limitation is in place to ensure fair usage, system stability, and high-quality analysis for all users.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Purpose of Rate Limiting:</strong> Automatic rate limiting helps maintain server stability and ensures a smooth experience for all users by preventing abusive or excessive requests.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Behavior Detection and Blocking:</strong> Our system uses advanced algorithms to detect suspicious or harmful activity. If such behavior is detected, your access may be temporarily blocked.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Temporary Blocks:</strong> Any restrictions imposed are temporary and will be lifted after a short period, allowing genuine users to resume normal access.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Compliance:</strong> By using Dreamia, you agree to comply with these measures and acknowledge that automatic rate limiting protects both our systems and users from abuse.
    If you believe your access was restricted in error, please contact our support team.
  </p>

  <h2>Refund and Activity Log Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    If you request a refund, your activity logs may be shared with the App Store or Google Play if necessary to verify your usage of the app.
    This helps ensure that refund requests for accidental subscriptions are reviewed fairly. Your privacy remains important to us, and such data sharing is limited strictly to refund verification purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms and Conditions</h2>
  <p>
    We may update our Terms and Conditions periodically. You are advised to review this page from time to time.
    Any updates will be posted here, and we will notify you of significant changes where appropriate.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 28, 2025</p>
